## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Deep Learning application that identifies various plant diseases from leaf images. Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model can accurately classify healthy and diseased plants, helping farmers take early action to save their crops.

## 🚀 Features
* **Image Upload:** Users can upload photos of plant leaves through a web interface.
* **Real-time Prediction:** The CNN model processes the image and returns the disease name.
* **User-friendly UI:** Built with Flask (Python) and HTML/CSS for a smooth experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
